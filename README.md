*Bug fixes made since the last release*

As this is the first release of this application, there are no bug fixes made since the last release.


*Known bugs and defects*
* Currently we do not have projections of the next semester’s expected enrollment.
* Did not make a separate page for comparisons due to testing finding it more useful to simply open the site in two windows in order to compare.
* The initial load time for the page is relatively high, but afterwards runs smoothly.
