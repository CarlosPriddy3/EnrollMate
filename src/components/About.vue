    <h1>About EnrollMate</h1>
    <p>The goal of Enrollmate is to lighten the load for administrators at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. Using our application, administrators can quickly search through all the classes being offered by UAH in order to more easily make decisions about which classes should be held where and what the class capacity should be. Classes that are near capacity are highlighted, and all listings have a details page that provides visualizations for past and current enrollment data. Overall our application allows users to make administrative decisions more quickly and in a more data driven manner.</p>
